geoHelper
=========

geoHelper will be a set of php classes to help in the daily work with geodata


Goals
-----
My goals for the geoHelper is to help me with my geoProblems
So there will be components for the following usecases:
 - Common GIS Geometry Objects
 - Distance calculation (in PHP and creating MySQL querys)

Features that will follow bit later:
 - GML/KML Parser/Converter
 - GeoJSON Parser/Converter

Cool to hae componetns would be
 - converting coordinates between differnet reference systems
 - WKT parser
 - PROJ.4 Parser

Requirements
------------
I will try to keep the requirements as minimal as possible
but my dev and productive envoyermetns are PHP 5.3 so this
is the Version i will support in the early stage
